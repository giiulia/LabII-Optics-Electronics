**Transfer functions** are necessary to understand the proper use of a circuit. We used a sine function generator to study the effects of the circuit on the pure value and phase of the transferred signal. Data are stored in [data.h](/Circuits-3/data.h) and the C++ program [circuits3.cpp](/Circuits-3/circuits3.cpp) runs the data analysis.

- The first part concerns how **RC and RL circuits** transfer signals.
- The second part is focused on **RCL, RLC and LCR** circuits.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](/Circuits-3/circuits3_report.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](/Circuits-3/circuits3_report.tex).
