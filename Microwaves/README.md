## The Microwaves
A cone shaped microwave emitter and a receiver were used to estimate intensity and polarization of incoming waves. Data are store in [data.cc](/Microwaves/data.cc) and analyzed in [microwaves.cpp](/Microwaves/microwaves.cpp).

The phenomena involved in this experience are the following:
- **Polarization**, we studied the effect of two polarizers on an unpolarized wave by changing the orientation angle of the cones. The difference that a metal grid can cause between them was also tested.
- Cartesio's law of **Reflection**.
- **Refraction** on a polystyrene prism of the microwaves.
- **Brewster's angle** of  reflection a for polyethylene foil. Determined by studying the correlation between the intensity of the wave detected by the receiver with its polarization.
- Maximums law for the **double slit** experiment.
- **Bragg reflection** was investigated with the help of a reticle sized on the order of centimeters.

In addition, a [virtual experiment](/Microwaves/Virtual_experiment) in which we exploited Malus' law to study the type of signal received was undertaken.
