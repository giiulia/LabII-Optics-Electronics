## The Microwaves

The phenomena involved in this experience are **polarization**, **reflection** and **refraction**, with a look at **Brewster's angle** and the **Bragg reflection**. A cone shaped microwave emitter and a receiver were used to estimate intensity and polarization of incoming waves. Data are store in [data.cc](/Microwaves/data.cc) and analyzed in [microwaves.cpp](/Microwaves/microwaves.cpp).

In addition, a [virtual experiment](/Microwaves/Virtual_experiment) in which we exploited Malus' law to study the type of signal received was undertaken.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](/Microwaves/microwaves_report.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](/Microwaves/microwaves_report.tex).
