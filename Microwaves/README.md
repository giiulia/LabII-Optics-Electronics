## The Microwaves
The affected phenomena are polarization, reflection and refraction, with a look at Brewster's angle and the Bragg reflection.
In [Microwaves](./#3:Microonde) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#3:Microonde/relazione_microonde.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#3:Microonde/relazione_microonde.tex).
