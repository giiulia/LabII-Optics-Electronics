## The Microwaves

The phenomena involved in this experience are polarization, reflection and refraction, with a look at Brewster's angle and the Bragg reflection. A cone shaped microwave emitter and a receiver were used to estimate intensity and polarization of incoming waves. Data are store in [data.cc](/Microwaves/data.cc) and analyzed in [microwaves.cpp](/Microwaves/microwaves.cpp).

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](/Microwaves/microwave_report.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](/Microwaves/microwave_report.tex).
