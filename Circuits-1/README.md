## Circuits 1
This project revolved aroud three topics:

- **Internal resistences** of electronic instruments to be used and **Ohm's law**;
- basic properties of **voltage dividers**;
- and characteristic current-tension of **diodes**.

Data are stored in [data.h](/Circuits-1/data.h) and were analyzed with the c++ program [circuits1.cpp](/Circuits-1/circuits1.cpp)

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](/Circuiti-1/circuits1_report.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](/Circuiti-1/circuits1_report.tex).
