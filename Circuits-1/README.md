## Circuits 1
Ohm's law, voltage dividers, and diodes had been the center of interest in this project. 
In [Circuits 1](./#4:Circuiti_1) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#4:Circuiti_1/relazione_circuiti1.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#4:Circuiti_1/relazione_circuiti1.tex).
