## The Interferometer
Using the *PASCO scientific* laboratory equipment, we implemented both the [Michelson](/Interferometer/Michelson) and the [Fabry-Perot](/Interferometer/Fabry-Perot) configurations of the interferometer.

- A [virtual testing experience](/Interferometer/Virtual_experiment) involving the calibration of a Fabry-Perot interferometer prepared us for the actual project.
- The lab project with the **Fabry-Perot configuration** started with the verification of **law of maximums of interference**: &delta;<sub>r</sub>$\frac{\lambda}{2\pi}$+2dcos(&theta;) = k&lambda;; it was also verified that cos(&theta;) $\simeq$ 1 if the wall is suffieciently distant from the laser. Therefore the relationship 2&Delta;d = &Delta;N&lambda; was used to calibrate the instrument with the help of a red laser of known wavelenght.
- By installing **Michelson's configuration** we noticed the higher accuracy that can be achieved using FP, however with Michelson's more interesting experiments can be done, such as evaluating the **refractive index of air** and **glass**.
- At last, we saw how a simple [ruler](/Interferometer/Ruler) can work as diffraction grating, and determined an estimate of its **pitch** (1mm).
