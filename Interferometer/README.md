## The Interferometer
Using the *PASCO scientific* laboratory equipment, we have implemented both the [Michelson](/Interferometer/Michelson) and the [Fabry-Perot](/Interferometer/Fabry-Perot) configurations of the interferometer.

-A virtual testing experience of calibration of a Fabry-Perot interferometer prepared us for the concrete project.
- The lab project with the FP configuration started with the verification of law of maximums of interference: &delta; ~r~ in a calibration of the instrumentation using a red laser of known wavelenght. Knowing how the caliber governates the mirrors of the cavity, 

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [PDF of report](/Interferometer/interferometer_report.pdf); if the source is of any interest its at: [source of report](/Interferometer/interferometer_report.tex).
