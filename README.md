# Lab II projects
Lab II is a laboratory course I took in my second year in BSc in Physics.

This is a collection of 6 distinct **group experiences** in university laboratories. Each project has been carefully reported and commented.
The following process has been necessary to reach the intent:
- **Data Store**
- **Data Analysis**
- **Result Display**

Each experience and so the relative report faces up the main phenomena of the topic of inquiry.
The topics of that year's course:


## Circuits 3

In [Circuits 3](./#6:Circuiti_3) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#4:Circuiti_3/relazione_circuiti3.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#4:Circuiti_3/relazione_circuiti3.tex).
