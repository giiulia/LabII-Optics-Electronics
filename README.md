# Lab II projects
Lab II is a laboratory course I took in my second year in BSc in Physics.

This is a collection of 6 distinct **group experiences** in university laboratories. Each project has been carefully reported and commented.
The following process has been necessary to reach the intent:
- **Data Store**
- **Data Analysis**
- **Result Display**

Each experience and so the relative report faces up the main phenomena of the topic of inquiry.
That year's topics were:

- The [spectrometer](/Spectrometer) and its applications.
- Michelson's and Fabry Perot's [interferometer](/Interferometer) configurations.
- [Microwaves](/Microwaves) and optical laws.
- Internal resistences of [electronic instruments](/Circuits-1).
- CR, LRC, RC [circuits](/Circuits-2).
- [Transfer functions](/Circuits-3) of the circuits previously studied.
