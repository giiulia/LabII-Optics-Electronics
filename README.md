# Lab II projects
Lab II is a laboratory course I took in my second year in BSc in Physics.

This is a collection of 6 distinct **group experiences** in university laboratories. Each project has been carefully reported and commented.
The following process has been necessary to reach the intent:
- **Data Store**
- **Data Analysis**
- **Result Display**

For each of these experiences, C++ scripts have been developed to meet the need.

In some cases, part of the project was carried-out virtually, so we labeled the relative data as "virtual".

Each experience and so the relative report faces up the main phenomena of the topic of inquiry.
The topics of this year's course:
## The Spectrometer
This apparatus was used in conjunction with discharge lamps and spectral tubes to inquire about the peculiarities of the prism and the graticule.
Each set of data has been stored differently. In [Spectrometer](./#1:Spettrometro) are visible all the sections and the relative data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#1:Spettrometro/relazione_spettrometro.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#1:Spettrometro/relazione_spettrometro.tex).

## The Interferometer
Using the *PASCO scientific* laboratory equipment, we have implemented both the Michelson and the Fabry-Perot configurations.
Each configuration's set of data has been stored differently. In [Interferometer](./#2:Interferometro) are visible all the sections and the relative data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#2:Interferometro/relazione_interferometro.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#1:Interferometro/relazione_interferometro.tex).

## The Microwaves
The affected phenomena are polarization, reflection and refraction, with a look at Brewster's angle and the Bragg reflection.
In [Microwaves](./#3:Microonde) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#3:Microonde/relazione_microonde.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#3:Microonde/relazione_microonde.tex).

## Circuits 1
Ohm's law, voltage dividers, and diodes had been the center of interest in this project. 
In [Circuits 1](./#4:Circuiti_1) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#4:Circuiti_1/relazione_circuiti1.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#4:Circuiti_1/relazione_circuiti1.tex).

## Circuits 2

In [Circuits 1](./#5:Circuiti_2) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#5:Circuiti_2/relazione_circuiti2.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#5:Circuiti_2/relazione_circuiti2.tex).

## Circuits 3

In [Circuits 3](./#6:Circuiti_3) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#4:Circuiti_3/relazione_circuiti3.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#4:Circuiti_3/relazione_circuiti3.tex).
