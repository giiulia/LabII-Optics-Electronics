# Lab II projects
Lab II is a laboratory course I took in my second year in BSc in Physics.

This is a collection of 6 distinct **group experiences** in university laboratories. Each project has been carefully reported and commented.
The following process has been necessary to reach the intent:
- **Data Store**
- **Data Analysis**
- **Result Display**

Each experience and so the relative report faces up the main phenomena of the topic of inquiry.
The topics of that year's course:

## The Microwaves
The affected phenomena are polarization, reflection and refraction, with a look at Brewster's angle and the Bragg reflection.
In [Microwaves](./#3:Microonde) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#3:Microonde/relazione_microonde.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#3:Microonde/relazione_microonde.tex).

## Circuits 1
Ohm's law, voltage dividers, and diodes had been the center of interest in this project. 
In [Circuits 1](./#4:Circuiti_1) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#4:Circuiti_1/relazione_circuiti1.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#4:Circuiti_1/relazione_circuiti1.tex).

## Circuits 2

In [Circuits 1](./#5:Circuiti_2) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#5:Circuiti_2/relazione_circuiti2.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#5:Circuiti_2/relazione_circuiti2.tex).

## Circuits 3

In [Circuits 3](./#6:Circuiti_3) are visible the data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](./#4:Circuiti_3/relazione_circuiti3.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](./#4:Circuiti_3/relazione_circuiti3.tex).
