## The Spectrometer
This apparatus was used in conjunction with discharge lamps and spectral tubes to inquire about the peculiarities of the prism and the [graticule](/Spectrometer/Graticule). The prism has been studied both with a [virtual experiment](/Spectrometer/Virtual_experiment) and a [concrete experiment](/Spectrometer/Prism).

- The aim of the virtual experiment was to verify the **Cauchy law** and determine the parameters of it for the medium of choice. We used various wavelenghts for this analysis. The material of the prism was to be determined by confonting the parameters with those tabulated.
- For the concrete experiment we got to use the spectrometer in real life using an **ignote source** and a know source for reference. We tracked the angles of each colored line we saw in the spectrometer for each source and identified the ignote one.
- The experience with the graticule had to goal of **estimating the graticule pitch** traking the yellow doublet of a sodium lamp relatively to the center. Subsequently we identified the spectral lines of **sodium**.
