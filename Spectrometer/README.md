## The Spectrometer
This apparatus was used in conjunction with discharge lamps and spectral tubes to inquire about the peculiarities of the [prism](/Spectrometer/Prism) and the [graticule](/Spectrometer/Graticule). In [Spectrometer](/Spectrometer) are visible all the sections and the relative data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](/Spectrometer/spectrometer_report.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](/Spectrometer/spectrometer_report.tex).
