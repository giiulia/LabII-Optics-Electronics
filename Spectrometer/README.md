## The Spectrometer
This apparatus was used in conjunction with discharge lamps and spectral tubes to inquire about the peculiarities of the prism and the graticule.
Each set of data has been stored differently. In [Spectrometer](/Spectrometer) are visible all the sections and the relative data and the data analysis.

The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](/Spectrometer/spectrometer_report.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](/Spectrometer/spectrometer_report.tex).
