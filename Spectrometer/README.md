## The Spectrometer
This apparatus was used in conjunction with discharge lamps and spectral tubes to inquire about the peculiarities of the prism and the [graticule](/Spectrometer/Graticule). The prism has been studied both with a [virtual experiment](/Spectrometer/Virtual_experiment) and a [concrete experiment](/Spectrometer/Prism).

- The aim of the virtual experiment was to verify the **Cauchy law** and determine the parameters of it for the medium of choice. We measured the angle of minimum deviation &delta; for different wavelenghts (&lambda;), and derived the refraction index for every &lambda;. The material of the prism was to be determined by confonting the parameters of the Cauchy law with those tabulated.
- For the concrete experiment we got to use the spectrometer in real life using a glass prism that we characterized and 2 sources: an **ignote source** and a known source (mercury) for reference. We tracked the angles of each colored line we saw in the spectrometer for each source and identified the ignote one, helium.
- The experience with the graticule had to goal of **estimating the graticule pitch** traking the yellow doublet of a sodium lamp relatively to the center of the image. Subsequently we identified the wavelenghts of the spectral lines of **sodium**.
