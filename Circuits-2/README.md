## Circuits 2

- The first part of the report is focused on characterizing **RC and CR circuits** and the decrease/increase of tension as time passes.
- The second part gets more interesting as **RLC circuits** are involved; we implemented studied the three damping regimes and drew the conclusions of each case.
 
The final product, with comments and hypotesis from our project group, is at [Pdf of report](/Circuits-2/circuits2_report.pdf); if the source is of any interest: [source of report](/Circuits-2/circuits2_report.tex).
